# PACMAN - CS383
 
For CS383: Algorithms at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I built a working game of Pacman across four projects throughout the semester. Each project builds a game of Pacman using various algorithmic techniques.

### Search

For the first project, I built upon existing code to design a game where Pacman finds paths through the maze while maximizing efficiency in finding food. We implement several search algorithms, including DFS, BFS, and A* Search.

### MultiAgent

To build on the basic search algorithms, I implemented minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax search algorithms for a more classic version of the game that includes ghosts. I also implemented an evaluation function, to evaluate states rather than actions like previous agents.

### Reinforcement Learning

This version of Pacman involves implementing value iteration and Q-learning.

### Ghostbusters

For the next iteration of Pacman, we were tasked to design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. 
Instead of just locating stationary ghosts, I wrote a Pacman agent capable of tracking multiple moving ghosts.
